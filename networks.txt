*** Switch vs HUB ***

- switch works at layer 2 and makes use of mac address.
- provides connectivity within same area between different computers connected through switch.
- unlike hub it does not broadcast messages to all recipients but rather to targeted one.
- communication on the same network
- allow devices to communicate on same network

*** Router ***

-  main job is to connect networks
-  when there is 2 different networks and person on A network tries to ping person on network B, the arp req sent from A
   is routed towards default gateway to identify router mac address.
-  gateway is also known as router
-  router just works on IP
